# Storage Groups Configuration Example
#
# This file defines Master/Backup drive relationships for data redundancy.
# Projects can be assigned to storage groups for automatic failover support.
#
# Phase 1: Relationship tracking only (no automatic sync)
# Phase 2: Sync functionality (manual trigger, scheduled, real-time)

# Configuration schema version (for future migrations)
version: 1

# List of configured storage groups
groups:
  # Example group 1: Photo archive with Master/Backup pairing

    # Master drive identification
    master_drive:
      serial_number: "1234567890ABC"  # Hardware serial (may be null on some platforms)
      label: "PhotoMaster"             # Volume label
      total_size: 2000000000000        # Total capacity in bytes (2 TB)

    # Backup drive identification
    backup_drive:
      serial_number: "9876543210XYZ"
      label: "PhotoBackup"
      total_size: 2000000000000

  # Example group 2: Video editing with different drive sizes
  - id: "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"
    name: "Video Projects"

    master_drive:
      serial_number: null              # No serial available (fallback to label+size)
      label: "VideoMaster"
      total_size: 4000000000000        # 4 TB

    backup_drive:
      serial_number: null
      label: "VideoBackup"
      total_size: 4000000000000

# Notes:
# - Drive matching uses serial_number first (exact match)
# - Fallback: label (exact match) + total_size (±5% tolerance)
# - Both drives must be removable (USB/external)
# - Groups can be created/edited via UI: Storage View → Manage Storage Groups
# - Projects link to groups via storage_group_id in project metadata
